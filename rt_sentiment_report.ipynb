    "# Rotten Tomatoes Sentiment Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Can short movie reviews be classified as positive or negative using TF-IDF features and classical machine learning models?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of Rotten Tomatoes movie reviews labeled as either positive (1) or negative (0). Each observation includes the review text and a binary sentiment label.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains about 10,000 reviews and is balanced between the two classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Source:  \n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/movie-review-data-set-from-rotten-tomatoes\n",
    "\n",
    "An 80/20 train-test split was used with `random_state=42`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Text data was converted into numerical features using `TfidfVectorizer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A scikit-learn `Pipeline` was used to combine TF-IDF feature extraction and model training. This ensures that preprocessing occurs inside each fold during cross-validation and avoids data leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three models were evaluated:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logistic Regression  \n",
    "- Linear Support Vector Machine  \n",
    "- XGBoost  \n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameters were tuned using `GridSearchCV` with 5-fold cross-validation.  \n",
    "F1-score was used as the primary selection metric, along with accuracy for reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The best-performing classical model achieved:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accuracy ≈ 0.77  \n",
    "- F1 ≈ 0.77  \n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression and Linear SVM performed similarly.  \n",
    "XGBoost performed slightly worse on this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF based linear models provide reasonable performance for binary sentiment classification on short reviews. For this dataset, simpler linear models were competitive and stable after cross-validation tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation details and full code are available in the accompanying notebook."
