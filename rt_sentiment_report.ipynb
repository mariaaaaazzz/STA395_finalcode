    "# Rotten Tomatoes Sentiment Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Can short movie reviews be classified as positive or negative using TF-IDF features and standard machine learning models?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of Rotten Tomatoes movie reviews labeled as positive (1) or negative (0). Each entry includes the review text and a binary sentiment label.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are about 10,000 reviews, and the dataset is roughly balanced between the two classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Source:\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/movie-review-data-set-from-rotten-tomatoes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The review text was converted into numerical features using 'TfidfVectorizer'.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid data leakage, TF-IDF transformation and model training were combined using a scikit-learn `Pipeline`, so preprocessing occurred within each fold during cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following models were compared:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logistic Regression  \n",
    "- Linear SVM  \n",
    "- XGBoost  \n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameters were tuned using `GridSearchCV` with 5-fold cross-validation. Model performance was evaluated using F1-score and accuracy on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The best classical model achieved:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accuracy $\\approx$ 0.77  \n",
    "- F1 $\\approx$ 0.77  \n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression and Linear SVM performed similarly, while XGBoost performed slightly worse on this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF features combined with linear models work reasonably well for short sentiment classification tasks. For this dataset, more complex models did not provide a clear advantage over simpler linear approaches."
